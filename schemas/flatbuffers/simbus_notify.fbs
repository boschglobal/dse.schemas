/*
    Notify Message
    ==============

    Notify Messages may be:

        * Sent TO a Model - indicating changed signals and/or simulation time.
        * Sent FROM a Model - indicating updated signals and/or model time.

    The SimBus algorithm operates based on the directionality of the Notify
    Messages, as well as available time fields. Each path/direction/time
    combination has different semantic reasoning applied.
